    <h4><b>Their Mission</b></h4>
    <br>
   <p> Every three minutes, a child is born with a cleft lip or cleft palate.
   <br><br>The majority of these children are unable to receive the medical care they need because it is too costly, far away, or specialized. Because of this, being born with a cleft condition can be fatal. If a child survives, they may face bullying and social isolation. 
   Through its expertise in treating cleft lip and cleft palate, Operations Smile creates solutions that deliver safe surgery to people where it’s needed most. 
   <br><br>What started as a family-led, medical-mission based organization has grown into a global network of passionate individuals united under the belief that access to safe surgery is not a privilege, but a universal human right.
 Empowering local health professionals through training and education creates surgical solutions that last. Operations Smile is proud that most of our medical volunteers are from the low-and middle-income countries we serve. By partnering with ministries of health, academic institutions, corporations, local health professionals and other organizations, its goal is to change lives and revolutionize how entire health systems deliver surgical care.
   </p><br>
   <h4><b>Their Vision</b></h4>
   <p>When members of the organisation meet families affected by cleft who live in some of the most impoverished communities in the world, they are reminded of the transformative effect surgery can have on the lives of people like Dede and his daughter Clara.
  </p>
    <br>
    <h4><b>Their Commitment to Comprehensive Care
    </b></h4>
    <p>Surgery is the first step in repairing a cleft condition, it can immediately improve a child’s ability to eat, breathe and speak. 
      After surgery, Operations Smile provides comprehensive care based on each child’s needs including dentistry, speech therapy and psychosocial support. This increases their likelihood of living a normal life, attending school and pursing a brighter future. Operations Smile is committed to treating the whole patient because it’s the right thing to do.</p>
