          <img src="u.png" width="20%">
        <br>UNICEF's mission is to drive change for children and young people every day, across the globe. <br>
       <h4><b>What is UNICEF?</b></h4>
        <p>UNICEF is the United Nations Children’s Fund, working in the world’s toughest places to reach the most disadvantaged children and adolescents – and to protect the rights of every child, everywhere.
       <br> One of the world’s largest providers of vaccines, UNICEF supports child health and nutrition, safe water and sanitation, quality education and skill building, HIV prevention and treatment for mothers and babies, and the protection of children and adolescents from violence and exploitation. 
      <br>Before, during and after humanitarian emergencies, UNICEF is on the ground, bringing life-saving help and hope to children and families</p>
        <br>
       
        <h4><b>What does the acronym UNICEF stand for?</b></h4>
        <p>On 11 December 1946, the United Nations established UNICEF to meet the emergency needs of children in post-war Europe and China. Our full name was the United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund. 
        </p>
          In 1950, the UNICEF mandate was broadened to address the long-term needs of children and women in developing countries everywhere. UNICEF became a permanent part of the United Nations system in 1953, when our name was shortened to the United Nations Children's Fund. However, UNICEF retained its original acronym. 
          <br>
          
        <h4><b>Where does UNICEF work? </b></h4>
            <p>UNICEF works in more than 190 countries and territories and in the world’s toughest places to reach the children and young people in greatest need.  
              They operate through country offices around the world, as well as 34 National Committees, seven regional offices, a research centre in Florence, a supply operation in Copenhagen, a shared services centre in Budapest, as well as other offices in Brussels, Geneva, Seoul, and Tokyo. Some 85 per cent of our staff are located in the field. UNICEF headquarters are in New York.
              </p>

         <br>          
        <h4><b>Take Action</b></h4>
